# Client-Server Socket

<p>In this project I have implemented a simple connection-oriented TCP Client Server Socket Using JOptionPane.</p>

<h4>Pre-req:-</h4>
You should have Java preinstalled on your machine.

<h3>Steps to Run:-</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Clone the repository.</li>
  <li>Open the project in Netbeans.</li>
  <li>Navigate to the src/javaapplication19 folder and run the Server.java file by Right Click > Run File </li>
  <li>Now run the Client.java file in a similar fashion.</li>
</ul>

<p>For any queries, you can mail me at sa126@snu.edu.in</p>

<p> It's a humble request that you Star or Fork the project instead of simply cloning it.</p>
